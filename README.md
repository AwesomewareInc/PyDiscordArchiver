Cheap and dirty Python program for archiving all Discord messages in a server to .json, for [DungeonArchive](https://github.com/IoIxD/DungeonArchive).

Simply put the token of the Discord bot you want to use to archive messages into a file named `key`, and then run `python3 main.py` and follow the prompts to get a json file that DungeonArchive will display.
